# TinyMobileApp
This is a public repo holding the code for a very basic initial Android Mobile Application created with Android Studio.

# Overview 
This application is a basic android mobile application built for the Tufts University Comp 150 Mobile Development course. This application has the following components:
* Calculator
* Cat Photo
* Find My Finger
* Velocity

## Calculator
This sub application is a basic calculator that allows the user to input two numbers and run basic mathematical functions on floats/ints such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Cat Photo
This sub application has a photo of a cat and allows the user to use a rate bar widget to rate the cat and lists the rating the user selects.

## Find My Finger
This sub application tells the user where there finger is. There finger may either be lifted (not touching the screen), pressed (clicking the screen and not moving), or moving (finger pressed on the screen and moving).

## Velocity
This sub application tells the user at what velocity their finger is upon leaving the screen in the vertical, horizontal, and combined directions. It uses the unit of measure pixels per second.

# Usage Instructions
To use this application, please download Android Studio to your device. You may find a download of that by going to this website https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html.
Clone this repo, and open Android Studio. Select 'Open an existing Android Studio Project' and select the application named 'TinyApp' in this repo. Build the gradle (compile) by pressing the 'Make Project' button, and run it by clicking the 'Run app' button. If you have not yet created a virtual device (emulator), I suggest the Nexus 5X API 26. You may need to create this new virtual device on your system. Then your emulator will run and will bring up the application.

# Running Requirements
This application will run on Android 6.0 (Marshmellow).

# documentation and resources used, etc.
